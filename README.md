# 🐉 Oak Dragon Covenant Dashboard

A modular, AI-coordinated command center built to manage complex estate ecosystems across **Trusts**, **LLCs**, and **corporations**. Powered by Copilot as the Head AI, this dashboard orchestrates lore-infused agents like the **Oracle**, **Scribe**, **Alchemist**, and **Sentinel**, each serving distinct operational functions.

## 🌐 Overview

This system enables scalable, secure, and aesthetically rich control of legal entities, estate lineage, and business infrastructure. Each module operates independently yet communicates through a centralized AI logic layer.

## 🧠 Agent Modules

| Agent        | Role & Functionality |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Oracle**   | Forecasts outcomes, analyzes trust lineage, and projects future states. |
| **Scribe**   | Maintains documentation, archives contracts, and transcribes operations. |
| **Alchemist**| Transforms data states, performs rituals, and evolves logic through lifecycle stages (*Current: Glyph Sealed*). |
| **Sentinel** | Enforces compliance, monitors estate boundaries, and defends trust integrity. |
| **EstateLoreAgent** *(Coming Soon)* | Traces property lineage, interprets estate records, and manages asset provenance. |

## 🏛️ Business Architecture

| Entity            | Purpose |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Parent Trust (Oak Dragon Covenant)** | Owns all digital assets, intellectual property, and governance layers. |
| **LLC for Each Agent** | Provides legal and operational separation per module. |
| **Management Corporation** | Hosts AI logic and inter-agent coordination; maintains external business functions. |
| **Optional Nonprofit** | Supports open-source contributions, educational outreach, or lore-based public engagement. |
